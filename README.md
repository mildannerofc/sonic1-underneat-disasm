Here are questions related to S.C.E and Under Neat Project.
## Why Under Neat?
Under Neat is also known as Under 500 in previously, but now it's scrapped with polished palette and stuff incoming. It had controversy where Mildanner has "stole" a music from the Boss Theme of Sonic 1 Definitive SHC 2021 and got him in Limbo, Mildanner got recently exiled because of his actions and he's trying and sometime he will redeem himself and gradual improvement of his behavior soon.
## Does this project can be played by other people?
Sure, but you need to provide a download link of this ROM Hack outside the disassembly.
## Can I see what they added in this hack?
No, it's only included branch of S2 Clone Driver and Mega PCM 2 by Vladikcomper and Clownacy. It's just for scrapped purposes, if you notice something taken from another project. Please make a pull request removal to the file and it will be replaced/removed from the ASM file project.
## Where do I find the used disassembly?
[Here you go.](https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-1-in-Sonic-3-S.C.E.-)
## But for learning code, how I do?
You should learn about ASM guide and code with other disassembly ROM Hack (Including one you work).
## How do you make palettes and edit sprites in Sonic 3?
Use [ClownMapEd](https://github.com/Clownacy/ClownMapEd) in which is recommended and HivePal if you want to edit palette even easier.
## Flex2 don't recognize Sonic 3 Kosinki Module Plus, how I do?
Use CLownMapEd still, or you can uncompress it and compress after editing the sprite.
